# Save File Portraits

This mod allows you to pick a portrait to display on your save file slots. You can choose a different one for each slot.

All portraits from vanilla can be picked, as well as portraits coming from mods that have a custom `Graphics/Portraits.xml` file: to be available for picking, an animation should follow the format `idle_[something]`. So `idle_test` will appear, but `talk_test` and `idle_test_alt` won't.
